            <h2>Project Background</h2>            
            <p>
                This project involved creating an interactive and responsive web application based on a project brief for a fictitious business, 
                <span class="client">The Haukai Restaurant</span>, 
                by following the web development process of discovery, design, development and testing, deployment and evaluation as discussed below.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Discovery section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                From the project brief, stakeholders were identified from which personas were created. Accessibility issues for a persona were considered and primary goals 
                for each persona of what they would want to achieve when using the web application were considered. Use cases for each persona&#39;s primary goal were also created.
            </p>
            <p>
                Functional and non&#45;functional requirements were identified by considering the client&#39;s goals and stakeholder requirements. These requirements were 
                also categorised using the MoSCoW method of &lsquo;<strong>Must have</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>Should have</strong>&rsquo;, 
                &lsquo;<strong>Could have</strong>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<strong>Will not have</strong>&rsquo; with reasons for the specified category.
            </p>
            <p>
                A feasibility study was conducted to compare two different development options, including a web application builder 
                &#40;<a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" title="More on Squarespace">Squarespace</a>&#41; and a self&#45;hosted content management system 
                &#40;<a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" title="More on WordPress">WordPress</a>&#41;, to make a recommendation to the client regarding which development 
                option to choose.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Design section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                A site map was created with Microsoft Word. <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" title="More on Figma">Figma</a> was used to create wireframes for 
                mobile displays of web pages together with corresponding wireframes for desktop displays. The design followed a mobile&#45;first approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                An interview and task&#45;based usability test was prepared and carried out with a potential user to obtain additional information about the usability of my design 
                by considering 
                <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" title="More on the usability heuristics">Jakob Nielson&#39;s 10 Usability Heuristics</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Design features were considered to ensure accessibility for users of the web application in line with 
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/" target="_blank" title="View the accessibility principles">W3C&#39;s Web Accessibility Principles</a>.

        <!-- Development section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p> 
                The web application was developed with a mobile&#45;first approach and written with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript programming languages. It includes some Google tools, such as 
                a Google form to request a reservation, a Google calendar and agenda to indicate opening hours and a Google map to show the restaurant&#39;s location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility features implemented include semantic HTML elements, correct use of headings and the &lsquo;alt&rsquo; attribute with HTML &lsquo;image&rsquo; elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usability features implemented include familiar social media icons, ensuring menu items, field labels and actions for buttons are visible on each page, and 
                ensuring the design is uncluttered, minimalistic and aesthetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Search Engine Optimisation &#40;SEO&#41; was implemented for online marketing purposes by including meta tags on each HTML page and verifying site ownership with Google, 
                thereby ensuring people can find the web application via Google.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <!-- Testing section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Testing of code was carried out with Chrome DevTools throughout the development phase to ensure the web application was functional. W3C standards for HTML and CSS were 
                implemented and tested with W3C&#39;s <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="Validate HTML Markup">HTML Markup</a> and 
                <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank" title="Validate CSS">CSS</a> Validation Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                The accessibility of the web application was tested and evaluated with 
                <a href="https://achecks.org/checker/index.php" target="_blank" title="Check web accessibility">AChecker&#39;s Web Accessibility Checker</a> and 
                <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" title="More on WAVE">WebAIM&#39;s WAVE</a> tool to ensure 
                accessibility guidelines were followed.
            </p>
            <p>
                A mobile&#45;friendly test was carried out for each web page with Google&#39;s Mobile&#45;Friendly Test tool to ensure responsive 
                design principles were implemented and the web application was mobile&#45;ready. However, this tool has now been replaced with Google&#39;s 
                <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview" target="_blank" title="More on Lighthouse">Lighthouse tool</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Page loading times were optimised with 
                <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/?utm_source=psi&utm_medium=redirect" target="_blank" title="Test page speeds">Google&#39;s PageSpeed Insights</a> tool 
                to ensure the home page loads within 2 seconds on a 4G network for both mobile and desktop displays.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Deployment section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Deployment</h2>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://tanyabyc.github.io/haukai.github.io" target="_blank" title="View the web application">web application</a> was uploaded to 
                a <a href="https://github.com/TanyabYC/haukai.github.io" target="_blank" title="View the repository">GitHub repository</a> and 
                hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" title="More on GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a> for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The authentication method of using a .htpasswd and .htaccess file for the staff information page could not be implemented on the GitHub server. 
                However, it was tested to be functional when using Uniform server with the correct file path.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Evaluation section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                A staff information page was lastly added and accessible from the home page to include a staff roster and staff contact details. The information contained on this page was 
                generated with mock data with the <a href="https://www.mockaroo.com/" target="_blank" title="Create mock data">Mockaroo</a> tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                An interview and task&#45;based usability test was prepared and carried out with a potential user for the staff information page to identify improvements that 
                could be made to ensure a good user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, recommendations were made to the client for entry&#45;level web hosting options, SSL certificate authorities&#47;providers and content delivery networks that were 
                considered and compared.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon further evaluation, adjustments could be made to the design of the web application on larger screens to allow content boxes to be placed&#47;stacked 
                next to each other as opposed to being placed&#47;stacked on top of each other. This will allow the web application to be more usable on these larger screens.
