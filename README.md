# My Diploma Projects
The project involved designing and building a mobile-friendly website to present and discuss projects I completed in a user-friendly way. These projects were completed for my diploma in Web Development and Design at <a href="https://www.openpolytechnic.ac.nz/" title="More on Open Polytechnic" target="_blank">Open Polytechnic NZ | Te Pukenga</a>.

The website needed to list the projects on the home page with a quick overview to help users quickly identify which projects they wanted to know more about. Each listed project needed to link to a project page with a more in-depth summary/report of what was involved during the development process. Each project page also needed to link to the source code and live web application or screenshots of the program in action to help users consider the code used to develop the project and view the final product.

The website also needed a user-friendly navigational menu to help users quickly navigate to other projects from any page.

A minimalistic design of the website was followed to make the website more user-friendly. Headings and links stand out with prominent colours to help users identify sections and links quickly and easily. Each page includes a link at the bottom to help users navigate back to the top.

Usability testing conducted revealed that users wanted to click on each project name from the home page to take them to the project page. Consequently, links were added to project names on the home page to support this functionality.

It is assumed that people who view this project and portfolio of work have already received my resume with contact information. A contact form was, therefore, not included in this website.

The project was completed within a month and involved summarising the development process of 8 projects with evidence of work completed. The website was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.
