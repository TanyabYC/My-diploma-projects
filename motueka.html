            <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <p>
                This project involved completing the development of a web application based on a design brief 
                for a fictitious business, <span class="client">The Motueka Bed &amp; Breakfast.</span>
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Discovery section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                Functional and non&#45;functional requirements were identified from the design brief and 
                additional requirements were suggested with reasons why they were important. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Rooms, room availability and making bookings needed to be available to customers. 
                Administrators also needed this functionality together with being able to manage rooms, 
                customers and bookings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Partially completed source code were provided for the rooms and customer PHP web pages, 
                whereas booking and login pages still needed to be developed. Paper&#45;based web page views 
                containing mock data were supplied for all web pages depicting basic functional requirements. 
                The source code provided needed additional updates to allow for authentication, authorisation, 
                session management, log&#45;out functionality and security measures that would protect parts of 
                the web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                A SQL database, which excluded a booking table, was also provided. It needed to be integrated 
                into the web application after designing and adding the booking table. However, some adjustments 
                needed to be made to the customer table to store customer login details.
            </p>
            <p>
                A privacy statement needed to be created and added on its own page within the web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                A workflow document was needed for both technical staff and end users that explains how they 
                should work with the completed system.
            </p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                The graphical user interface &#40;GUI&#41; for the web application would be designed by another 
                team and did not form part of this project. Adding information about the Bed &amp; Breakfast was 
                also excluded from the project.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Development section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                The web application was developed and written with HTML5, PHP and JavaScript programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                PHP web pages were first developed as HTML5 web pages before converting them to PHP and adding 
                PHP code. HTML5 date and time picker was first implemented before replacing it with a JavaScript 
                date and time picker. The index or home page was created and integrated into the web application&#39;s 
                navigational menus for testing purposes. This would be replaced once the proper page is developed 
                by another development team.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript technologies and libraries implemented include&#58;                
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    jQuery UI library with a date picker widget for when the user makes or updates a booking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript Object Notation &#40;JSON&#41; to search for room availability before making a 
                    booking and when administrators search for customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    AJAX to help content load asynchronously without waiting for the whole web page to reload.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The SQL database was updated to add the booking table with sample data and amend the customer 
                table to add login functionality to the web application. Passwords that needed to be stored 
                directly in the database, such as an administrator password, were encrypted before being stored. 
                SQL statements were coded and added to the booking and log&#45;in pages to communicate with the 
                database.
            </p>
            <p>
                Security measures implemented include&#58;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTML5 data validation for user input fields to prevent users from entering incorrect 
                    information and control the type of data sent to the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Parameterised prepared SQL statements to prevent the efficacy of SQL injection attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Filtering and encoding data to mitigate Cross&#45;site Scripting &#40;XSS&#41; attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Encrypting passwords before sending them to the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Verifying passwords entered during log&#45;in and comparing them against encrypted 
                    passwords stored in the database to authenticate users.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Authentication, authorisation, session management and log&#45;out functionality were implemented. 
                A default username and password of &lsquo;root&rsquo; was added to the database to test pages viewed by 
                administrators. For security reasons, this would need to be updated within the database before 
                going live to allow for a private administrator username and password.
            </p>
            <p>
                The privacy statement was created with the 
                <a 
                    href="https://privacy.org.nz/tools/privacy-statement-generator/" 
                    target="_blank" title="More on the privacy statement generator">
                    Privacy Statement Generator</a> 
                after identifying the type of private identifiable information &#40;PII&#41; that would 
                be collected by the web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                A workflow document was created for technical staff to explain configuration and maintenance 
                procedures and for end users to explain how the booking pages work.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>
                A test plan was created and executed to test the functionality and usability 
                of the web application after deployment on multiple platforms.
            </p>

            <h2>Deployment</h2>
            <p>
                A list of things to check before and after publishing to a hosting provider was created and 
                followed before deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hosting was not included in the design brief. Consequently, free hosting providers were 
                considered based on bandwidth, storage, processing power and memory, customer service and 
                support, free subdomain or domain, scalability and cost criteria. 
                <a href="https://www.awardspace.com/free-hosting/" target="_blank" title="More on AwardSpace">
                    AwardSpace</a> was found to be the most suitable for this project and was used to host and publish this

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                An SSL certificate would encrypt communications with the server and could further protect 
                sensitive data, such as passwords. Unfortunately, at the time of development, the hosting 
                provider did not offer a free SSL certificate with their free plan unless it was upgraded 
                to a paid plan. However, the client could organise this with their hosting provider when 
                purchasing their hosting plan and domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                The web application does not allow customers to reset their passwords. Further enhancements 
                could involve updating the Account Details View page instead with customer contact details 
                and e-mail preferences and adding a password reset button for customers to reset their 
                passwords via an e-mail link.
            </p>
            <P>
                Cross&#45;Origin Resource Sharing &#40;CORS&#41; headers could be implemented to mitigate 
                Cross&#45;Site Request Forgery &#40;CSRF&#41; attacks.
